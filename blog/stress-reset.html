    <h1 class="h1">How Teens Can Reset Stress and Regain Calm</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Between school, social life, sports, and screens, stress can feel constant.  
      Here’s how to reset your body and brain when pressure builds up — with simple, real-world strategies you can actually use.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 class="h2">Understanding stress (and why it’s not always bad)</h2>
    <p>
      Stress is your body’s alarm system — a built-in way to keep you alert and focused.  
      But when the “on” switch stays stuck, stress starts draining energy and mood instead of helping.  
      The goal isn’t to remove stress completely; it’s to manage how your body and mind respond to it.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Short-term stress</strong> can boost motivation and focus (like before a test or game).</li>
      <li><strong>Chronic stress</strong> builds up when rest and recovery never happen.</li>
      <li><strong>Burnout</strong> is the crash that follows too much pressure with too little support.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>“You can’t always control what happens, but you can control how your body resets.”</blockquote>

    <h2 class="h2">How stress shows up (body, brain, behavior)</h2>
    <p>
      Stress looks different for everyone — but here are common signals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Body:</strong> tight shoulders, headaches, upset stomach, poor sleep, fatigue.</li>
      <li><strong>Mind:</strong> racing thoughts, zoning out, irritability, perfectionism.</li>
      <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> procrastination, social withdrawal, overworking, scrolling endlessly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2">Step 1: Calm your body first</h2>
    <p>
      When your body relaxes, your brain follows. Try a quick “reset” technique whenever stress spikes:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Box Breathing:</strong> Inhale for 4 seconds, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4. Repeat for 1–2 minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>Progressive Relaxation:</strong> Tense and release each muscle group from head to toe.</li>
      <li><strong>Cold Splash Reset:</strong> Rinse hands or face with cool water — it activates a calming nerve pathway.</li>
      <li><strong>Move:</strong> Walk, stretch, or shake out your arms. Motion helps burn off stress hormones.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="muted small">Try one before tests, games, or social situations — it trains your body to switch out of “fight or flight.”</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Step 2: Reframe your thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Stress often comes from how we <em>interpret</em> events. Reframing helps your brain see problems with more perspective:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>From</strong> “I’ll never get this done.” → <strong>To</strong> “It’s a lot, but I can start one piece.”</li>
      <li><strong>From</strong> “Everyone’s ahead of me.” → <strong>To</strong> “Everyone has off days. I can catch up.”</li>
      <li><strong>From</strong> “I failed.” → <strong>To</strong> “I learned what to change next time.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Writing or saying reframed thoughts out loud rewires your brain’s stress circuits over time — it’s real neuroscience.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2">Step 3: Build recovery into your day</h2>
    <p>
      Stress recovery isn’t only about rest; it’s about micro-moments that recharge you.  
      The most resilient people don’t avoid stress — they <strong>balance it</strong> with recovery habits.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Small resets to sprinkle through your day</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2-minute breaks:</strong> look out a window, stretch, or do slow breathing.</li>
      <li><strong>Digital pauses:</strong> set a “tech boundary” 30 minutes before bed.</li>
      <li><strong>Micro connection:</strong> check in with a friend, teacher, or family member.</li>
      <li><strong>Mini goals:</strong> focus on one small task instead of the full to-do list.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted small">These mini-breaks train your nervous system to reset faster each time.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Step 4: Create a personal reset routine</h2>
    <p>
      Everyone’s “reset” looks different — but all good routines share three parts:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Body cue:</strong> breathing, walk, or stretch.</li>
      <li><strong>Mental cue:</strong> journaling, music, affirmations, or gratitude note.</li>
      <li><strong>Environment cue:</strong> changing location, stepping outdoors, dimming lights, or cleaning your space.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Combine one from each group and use it when stress builds. Example: <em>go outside → breathe → text a friend.</em>
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2">Stress + screens: managing digital overload</h2>
    <p>
      Your brain processes online stress the same way as real stress. Doomscrolling, constant notifications,  
      or comparing yourself to others keeps adrenaline up even when you’re “resting.” Try:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Turn off non-essential notifications during homework or study.</li>
      <li>Unfollow or mute accounts that trigger anxiety or comparison.</li>
      <li>Keep your phone out of reach for the first 20 minutes after waking up.</li>
      <li>Use “Do Not Disturb” during meals or hangouts — presence resets your brain chemistry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2">Nutrition & sleep: the hidden stress buffers</h2>
    <p>
      Your body can’t handle stress if it’s under-fueled or under-rested. Simple tweaks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Eat balanced meals:</strong> protein + fiber + healthy fats keep blood sugar steady and prevent mood crashes.</li>
      <li><strong>Hydrate:</strong> dehydration raises cortisol (the stress hormone).</li>
      <li><strong>Prioritize sleep:</strong> 8–10 hours recharges your nervous system and improves focus.</li>
      <li><strong>Cut caffeine after lunch:</strong> caffeine lingers for hours and worsens anxiety for many teens.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2">When stress gets too heavy</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes stress becomes overwhelming — constant sadness, panic attacks, trouble eating or sleeping, or thoughts of hopelessness.  
      That’s not weakness; it’s your brain asking for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reach out to a school counselor, parent, or helpline. You don’t need to face it alone.  
      Talking about stress early prevents burnout later.

    </p>

    <h2 class="h2">Three-day reset plan</h2>
    <p>
      Try this short reset to help your body and brain recalibrate:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Identify your top 3 stress triggers. Write them down and note what’s in your control.</li>
      <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> Practice 5 minutes of deep breathing or journaling before bed.</li>
      <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> Do one positive connection — call a friend, share a laugh, or do something kind.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="h2">Your personal “Calm Plan”</h2>
    <p>
      Make a quick reference card or phone note with your top 5 resets:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>My body cue: __________</li>
      <li>My mental cue: __________</li>
      <li>My environment cue: __________</li>
      <li>People I can reach out to: __________</li>
      <li>One quote or mantra that helps me breathe again: __________</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2">Key takeaway</h2>
    <p>
      Stress isn’t the enemy — it’s a signal. Learning to reset instead of react builds real resilience.  
      Every breath, walk, laugh, and boundary teaches your body you’re safe again. And that’s the foundation of strength.
