      <h2 class="h3">Why sleep matters</h2>
      <p>Sleep supports memory, mood, immune function, and athletic performance. Teens typically need 8–10 hours per night.</p>

      <h2 class="h3">Tiny habits to try</h2>
        <p> A lot of people think sleep is just what happens when you run out of energy, but that’s really not how it works. For teenagers especially, sleep is one of the most important tools you have for staying healthy, keeping your mood in check, and actually performing well in school.
According to major sleep experts (like the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the CDC), teens who are aged between 13-18 need around 8–10 hours of sleep a night. Not everyone needs the exact same amount, but getting four hours and staying up watching YouTube absolutely isn’t enough. Most teens don’t get close to what they need, and you can feel the effects pretty quickly. Being tired isn’t just “feeling tired”, your brain and body slow down.
Your brain actually does a ton of work while you’re asleep. It goes through everything you learned during the day and sorts it out so it sticks. Most of this happens during REM sleep. When you cut your sleep short, your brain just doesn’t have time to do its job.
</p>
        <p> This is why sleep has such a big impact on school. When you’ve actually slept enough, it’s easier to pay attention, remember things, and think clearly. When you’re running on not enough sleep, your focus drops, your memory gets worse, and even basic assignments feel like a chore.
On top of that, teens’ brains are still developing, especially the parts that control emotions and decision-making. When you’re sleep-deprived, those areas don’t work as well. That’s why everything feels more stressful or dramatic when you’re tired. Getting enough sleep makes your mood way more stable and helps you handle everyday problems without getting overwhelmed.
And while your brain is doing all that organizing, your body is repairing itself too. Your muscles recover, your body releases key hormones, and your immune system gets stronger. So sleep literally helps you grow, feel better, and stay healthy.
In the end, making sleep a priority is one of the best things you can do for yourself. It affects everything: your health, your mood, your energy, and how well you do in school.
I tried to also make it sound like “teen” level, not too formal</p>
